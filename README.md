# All-projects
Set of all relevant projects done during my university career.
1. Biomechanics project: 
   - MotRec: you’ll find there all the MATLAB code I used throughout the project. Everything related to data processing, analysis, and visualization is 
             organized there.
   - biomech_report: contains the complete documentation of the project, including the objectives, methodology, results, and final considerations.
2. Progetto Paralympics: this was the first presentation of a project still under development, during which we introduced our idea for a modification 
   aimed at improving comfort during the use of the trike. The proposed intervention focuses on optimizing the vehicle’s ergonomics, reducing physical 
   strain, and enhancing the overall user experience, especially during extended sessions.
3. Progetto economia:
   - Presentazione_SANOFI: project presentation
   - Progetto Sanofi: Excel spreadsheet containing all the calculations related to the analysis
4. Tesi triennale:
   - Tesi triennale: this is the final version of the report for my Bachelor's thesis, which includes a detailed description of the project, the 
                     methodology used, and the results obtained.
   - Parametri: this section includes the calculation of all the relevant parameters used for processing and interpreting the results.
   - Preprocessing: this folder contains the preprocessing phase of the acquired signals, including all the steps needed to clean and prepare the data 
                    for analysis.
5. Transport Phenomena Project:
   - Demo: folder contains the codes used during the development of the project,
   - Report: folder includes the actual final report of the work carried out, which served as an example of the application of the Windkessel model.
6. AutoCAD_microynano is a CAD drawing created for the design of certain chips. In the project, we then focused on the manufacturing techniques of the
   chips themselves and their production process.
